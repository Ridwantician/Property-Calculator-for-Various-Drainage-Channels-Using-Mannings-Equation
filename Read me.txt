1. The pictures in the picture box were manually added from my file path on my PC. Hence, you need to edit the path to suit your location.

2. All the required pictures are uploaded in the repository.

3. In cases when you're working with a circular channel, what you need is diameter D not width b. However, insert the value for your D in the textbox provided for b. The program will use it correctly.

4. Only a parabolic channel requires shape factor k, but you are expected to put a value for shape factor for any type of section you want to calculate. The program is built not to tun if one or more input variables are not entered. However, be rest assured that the program will use only the required input for your specific section type.

5. The program will not run if you do not select any section type.

6. The program will also not run if you don't select any unit system.
